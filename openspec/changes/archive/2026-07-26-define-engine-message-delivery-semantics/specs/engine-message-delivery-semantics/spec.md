## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Message Delivery MUST Use Explicit Intent

Every engine message delivery request MUST declare `prompt`、`steer`、`followUp` or `nextTurn` and MUST return a typed accepted、rejected or degraded result.

#### Scenario: caller omits intent

- **WHEN** a new delivery caller provides message content without intent
- **THEN** typecheck or command validation MUST reject the request

### Requirement: Steering MUST Require Active Run And Mid-Turn Capability

`steer` MUST only target an active run whose adapter reports `input.mid-turn=supported`.

#### Scenario: Kimi receives steering request

- **WHEN** Kimi has no writable mid-turn input channel
- **THEN** steering MUST be rejected with capability reason
- **AND** the system MUST NOT report the message as sent

#### Scenario: caller explicitly permits fallback

- **WHEN** steering is unsupported and caller explicitly requests follow-up fallback
- **THEN** the result MUST identify the degradation
- **AND** the message MUST enter the follow-up queue exactly once

### Requirement: Follow-Up MUST Drain Only After Run Settlement

Follow-up items MUST remain queued until the predecessor emits `run.settled`; response acceptance、delta or engine-specific turn completion MUST NOT drain the queue.

#### Scenario: duplicate settlement arrives

- **WHEN** the same run settlement is observed more than once
- **THEN** each follow-up item MUST be delivered at most once

### Requirement: Delivery Decisions MUST Be Diagnosable

Every delivery decision MUST record intent、target session/run、capability evidence、result and fallback reason without storing secrets.

#### Scenario: message is rejected

- **WHEN** runtime/session state makes delivery impossible
- **THEN** UI MUST receive an actionable reason
- **AND** diagnostics MUST preserve the decision evidence
