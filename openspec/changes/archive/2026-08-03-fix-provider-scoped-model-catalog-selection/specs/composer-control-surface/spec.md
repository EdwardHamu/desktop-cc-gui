## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Composer Selection Repair MUST Converge

When provider catalog hydration repairs the active thread model or reasoning effort, the Composer MUST publish the normalized selection to both durable storage and active in-memory selection state.
Persisting a semantically equal selection MUST preserve state identity and MUST NOT trigger another
render.

#### Scenario: active provider selection is repaired

- **WHEN** catalog hydration determines that the active provider thread selection requires repair
- **THEN** cache, durable storage, active selection ref, and active selection state MUST observe the same normalized value
- **AND** the next render MUST NOT schedule the same repair again

#### Scenario: repeated equal persistence

- **WHEN** the active thread receives a persistence request equal to its current normalized selection
- **THEN** active selection state MUST retain its existing reference
- **AND** no additional render MUST be scheduled

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Provider Groups MUST Use Provider-Scoped Model Catalogs

The grouped Composer model selector MUST resolve each engine group from provider-scoped catalog facts rather than treating the active engine `models` array as the catalog for every provider. When the active thread has a persisted managed provider binding, its active engine group MUST contain only that provider's configured models plus public models, with deterministic dedupe.

#### Scenario: active managed provider uses its catalog

- **WHEN** a new or restored Claude Code, Codex, or Kimi thread has managed `providerProfileId=A`
- **THEN** the active engine model group MUST use provider A's configured models
- **AND** it MUST append public models
- **AND** it MUST NOT include models owned only by provider B or the disk/global provider

#### Scenario: provider and public model duplicate

- **WHEN** the active provider catalog and public catalog contain the same runtime model identity
- **THEN** the selector MUST show one row
- **AND** the provider-owned label and metadata MUST take precedence

#### Scenario: provider-scoped Codex model preserves reasoning capabilities

- **WHEN** a provider-scoped Codex model matches an authoritative Codex catalog row by normalized runtime model identity
- **THEN** missing `supportedReasoningEfforts` and `defaultReasoningEffort` MUST be inherited from the authoritative row
- **AND** provider-owned label, origin, profile binding, and explicit reasoning metadata MUST remain authoritative
- **AND** an unmatched provider-only model MUST NOT receive inferred reasoning capabilities

#### Scenario: user selects an arbitrary provider-bound Codex model

- **WHEN** an active provider-bound Codex thread stores a non-empty user-selected model name
- **THEN** Composer MUST preserve the selected model without requiring membership in the current or global Codex catalog
- **AND** temporary catalog loading, refresh, or absence MUST NOT invalidate the selection
- **AND** selection repair MUST NOT replace it with a global/default model
- **AND** blank model names MUST continue through the existing fallback path

#### Scenario: user selects an arbitrary provider-bound Claude Code model

- **WHEN** an active provider-bound Claude Code thread stores a non-empty user-selected model name
- **THEN** Composer MUST preserve the selected model without requiring membership in the current Claude catalog
- **AND** temporary catalog loading, refresh, or absence MUST NOT invalidate the model or its reasoning effort
- **AND** selection repair MUST NOT replace it with a default model
- **AND** blank model names MUST continue through the existing fallback path

#### Scenario: switching parallel provider sessions updates catalog

- **WHEN** the same workspace contains active sessions bound to different provider profiles
- **AND** the user switches the active session
- **THEN** the selector MUST load and display the newly active session's provider-scoped catalog
- **AND** an older request MUST NOT overwrite the new session's model list

#### Scenario: non-active Claude group has Claude catalog

- **WHEN** the active Composer provider is not `Claude Code`
- **AND** Claude Code has settings/env or user custom model entries
- **THEN** the grouped selector MUST include a Claude Code group
- **AND** that group MUST use Claude Code model entries instead of the active provider's model list

#### Scenario: non-active Codex group has Codex catalog

- **WHEN** the active Composer provider is not `Codex`
- **AND** Codex has built-in, config-derived, runtime, or user custom model entries
- **THEN** the grouped selector MUST include a Codex group
- **AND** that group MUST use Codex model entries instead of the active provider's model list

#### Scenario: provider footer action targets effective provider

- **WHEN** a provider group is rendered in the selector
- **THEN** add-model and refresh-config footer actions MUST remain scoped to the effective selected provider context
- **AND** refreshing a provider group MUST NOT start, stop, or restart a conversation runtime
